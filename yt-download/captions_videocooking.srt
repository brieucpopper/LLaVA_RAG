1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,040
you might be surprised by how easy it is

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,799
to make crepes at home

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,120
here's a basic recipe you can try for

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,240
yourself start by sifting pastry flour

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,840
into a large bowl

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,519
sifting the flour helps to get rid of

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,719
lumps in the batter so your crepes come

8
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,559
out beautifully smooth

9
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,160
next add one tablespoon of sugar and a

10
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,080
quarter teaspoon of salt to the flour

11
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,199
and whisk to combine now it's time to

12
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,279
add the wet ingredients

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,720
starting with milk we used whole milk

14
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,119
but pretty much any kind of milk will

15
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,960
work

16
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,560
followed by two whole eggs give the

17
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,240
batter a really good whisk

18
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,000
this isn't like pancake batter where you

19
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,760
want to leave lumps for the ideal

20
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,520
crepe batter you need it super super

21
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,200
smooth so to ensure there are absolutely

22
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,880
no lumps strain the batter through a

23
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,440
sieve and use a spatula to push it

24
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,360
through

25
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,280
now you're ready to start cooking melt

26
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,879
some butter in a non-stick or cast iron

27
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,559
pan over medium heat

28
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,640
use a ladle to scoop a portion of the

29
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,559
batter into the pan then gently swirl

30
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,920
the pan so the batter spreads out evenly

31
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,440
across the surface

32
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,360
cook for about one minute then use a

33
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,039
spatula to gently flip the crepe

34
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,280
and cook for about another minute on the

35
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,440
other side this recipe will make roughly

36
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,039
8 to 10 crepes of this size

37
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,120
you're now ready to add any filling you

38
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,799
like we stuck with the classic nutella

39
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,199
but fruit or jam would be amazing as

40
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,880
well

41
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,400
fold the crepe into quarters and you're

42
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,840
ready to serve

43
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,840
